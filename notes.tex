 - Goals
 - Scope: subject area, delimitation, task description
 - Why did we choose this task?
 - The team
   - Who we are / the team members
   - Academic backgrounds
   - Roles
   - Decision making
 - Structure of the report
 
2. Theory
  - what is a good image
  - About Face quality metrics
  
  Assessment
  - objective assessment: explain objective assessment, what does the algorithms output?, explain faceQnet, ISO_metrics
  - Subjective assessment: explain subjective, how to setup survey, type of people (age, etc..), results, what could be done better
  - explain experiment: explain correlation between subjective and objective
  
  Development process
  - Requirements
  - Design
  - Development methods
  - Testing: unit testing, user testing
  
  Results
  - show front-end/back-end
  - discuss correlation between subj/obj. assessment
  - conclusion to experiment: can the two algorithms be used further? how are the objective similar to the subjective? same quality scores? 
  
 
 2d score graph. x-axis objective scores, y-axis subjective scores. plot each images scores to see correlation.
