\chapter*{Abstract}
The performance of face recognition systems are dependent on the quality of images used for their training and testing. To automatically evaluate the quality of facial images, Face Image Quality Metrics (FIQMs) are used. Such metrics provide an objective score which corresponds to how well the face is visible. In this project we introduce a web application which is able to calculate such objective scores for two different state-of-the-art FIQMs. To evaluate the accuracy of the mentioned FIQMs we collected subjective scores from expert and non-expert observers for three different available datasets of facial images. Further on we also collected a new facial image dataset which we believe is superior to current public datasets. This superiority is with regards to the number of images provided, the type of distortions the images are affected by, and also the nature of the images themselves (images with face covering by masks and images taken at an oblique angle). Our results show that the objective scores calculated by the two FIQMs have a low to moderate correlation with the subjective scores we have collected in our subjective experiments.
