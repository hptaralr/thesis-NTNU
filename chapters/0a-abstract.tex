\chapter*{Abstract}

The performance of face recognition systems are dependent on images used for training and analysis. There are metrics that automatically can calculate the quality of the images. In this project we have evaluated two face image quality metrics provided by Mobai. The project consisted of creating a web application that automates the process of evaluating datasets and that can easily add new FIQMs into the application. We are also comparing the scores provided by the FIQMs with human assessments by arranging a subjective experiment to collect ground truth data. 


The performance of face recognition systems are dependent on images used for training and analysis. There are metrics that automatically can calculate the quality of images. In this project we have evaluated two face image quality metrics provided by Mobai. The project consisted of creating a web application that evaluates images by the use of different Face Imaqe Quality Metrics (FIQM). We have also conducted a subjective experiment to collect ground truth data on three datasets Mobai gave us and compared them with the scores from the FIQMs to see the correlation. Further, we have expanded the task by creating our own dataset consisting of new aspects and distortions, and conducted a new subjective experiment. The subjective results from this dataset has then been used to correlate with the two FIQMs.
